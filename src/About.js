          <p>
            Becoming a computer scientist was my dream. My interest to become a
            computer scientist and software development roots in my passion to
            solve real life problems. Throughout my past four years at SFU, I
            worked on group projects as well as personal projects. In my
            projects, my focus was to apply efficient algorithms and appropriate
            data structures to solve problems. I mostly used C, C++, Python, and
            Golang programming languages. I have also built Web Apps using Node,
            Angular, React and ASP.NET. My personal projects provides a good
            grasp of knowledge in C, C++, Python, Golang, JavaScript and Matlab.
